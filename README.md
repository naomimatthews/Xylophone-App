# Xylophone App

This Xylophone App is a simple iOS application developed in Swift that allows users to play different musical notes on a virtual xylophone.

## Features

- Play different musical notes by tapping on the corresponding colored bars on the xylophone.
- Each bar produces a unique sound when tapped.
- The app provides an interactive and engaging experience for users to explore music and create melodies.

## How It Works

The Xylophone App is built using Swift and utilizes the following concepts:

- **Swift Functions**: Functions are used to encapsulate the logic for playing different sounds when a button is pressed.

- **IBActions**: Interface Builder actions (IBActions) are used to link multiple buttons to a single function that handles sound playback. This reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.

- **Sound Playback**: The app leverages the AVFoundation framework to play pre-recorded sounds for each xylophone bar.

- **Creating Functions with Inputs**: Functions are defined to take input parameters that specify the sound to be played. This allows reusability of code and flexibility in playing different sounds for different buttons.


## Getting Started

To download and run the Xylophone App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Xcode project file (`Xylophone.xcodeproj`) in Xcode.

3. Connect your iOS device or choose a simulator as the deployment target.

4. Build and run the app using the "Play" button in the Xcode toolbar.
